<h2>Achievements</h2><p></p>
<p>In August 2015 I was asked to, from scratch, create a project 
  plan with the goal of building a new Access Point network in the 
  Nordics. Starting with a blank piece of paper I planned, built, 
  trained and managed that field-based project successfully. This 
  has culminated in an efficient, effective, professional field 
  network being fully operational throughout the Nordics, one that 
  myself and the recruited team are very proud of.</p>
