<h3>War Pigs by Black Sabbath</h3>
<p>This was one of the first songs that got me into heavy metal!</p>
<h3>Stargazer by Rainbow</h3>
<p>The combination of Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio creates the perfect song!</p>

<p>I was amazed by the power of this song and have listened to Metallica ever since!</p>
